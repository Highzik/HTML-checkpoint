This is the HTML-checkpoint
I basically did everything that I learned in HTML in this project.
I hope it can be reviewed and point out where I should work better on
I have all my CSS stylings done internally
I made changes in the index page by adding audios in the page, but I kept getting the message saying "there is a repositor working at the background" which made it difficult for me to commit my changes.
